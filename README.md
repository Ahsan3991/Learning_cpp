Welcome to journey in understanding and learning C++. I have been really interested in embedded systems and programming since I was first introduced to it at my university but unfortunately at the time there were not much resources to learn and improve.
But now, I have reignited my passion and within a span of few weeks managed to not only revised the basic concepts but have also started making projects. This repository shall contains all such projects including my practice codes. Just go to the 
master branch and feel free to jump from one directory to another and check out my various shenanigans with C++. I have dived deep into the concepts of arrays, pointers, object oriented programming with classes, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism and linked lists and many more....




In Future:
Moving on, I want to develop embedded projects using different boards like discovery (STM32), Rpi and I also want to learn to use RUST for embedded development and how to integrate C++ functionalities with RUST or Python. I also want to make
GUI based applications written in C++ and Python which would help me learn app development and cross platform tools as well.
